# Settings & Configuration

## Trigger
Use when the user wants to view or modify instance settings, subchannels, UDFs, event hooks, or understand configuration options.

## Preferred: MCP tools
Use the plugin's `enneo_*` MCP tools whenever one exists for the operation — they use the stored Enneo API key/JWT and return typed results. The curl examples below document the underlying REST API and serve as a fallback for operations not yet wrapped by an MCP tool.

## curl Reference

The MCP server writes the configured instance and API key/JWT to `~/.enneo/env`. Source it to use curl directly:

```bash
. ~/.enneo/env   # exports ENNEO_INSTANCE, ENNEO_TOKEN, ENNEO_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT
BASE="https://${ENNEO_INSTANCE}/api/mind"
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer ${ENNEO_TOKEN}"
```

## Get Settings

```bash
# All settings
curl -s "${BASE}/settings" -H "${AUTH}" | jq '[.[] | {name, value, category}]'

# Compact (key-value)
curl -s "${BASE}/settings/compact" -H "${AUTH}"

# Filter by name
curl -s "${BASE}/settings?filterByName=enableAi" -H "${AUTH}"

# Filter by category
curl -s "${BASE}/settings?filterByCategory=email" -H "${AUTH}"

# Filter by module
curl -s "${BASE}/settings?filterByUsedBy=cortex" -H "${AUTH}"

# Only when explicitly needed: include secret values in settings output
curl -s "${BASE}/settings?showSecrets=true" -H "${AUTH}"

# By category (grouped)
curl -s "${BASE}/settings/category/{category}" -H "${AUTH}"

# Search
curl -s "${BASE}/settings/search?q=last+agent+routing" -H "${AUTH}"
```

## Update Settings (REQUIRES CONFIRMATION)

```bash
# Single setting
curl -s -X PUT "${BASE}/settings/{settingName}" \
  -H "${AUTH}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"new-value"'

# JSON setting
curl -s -X PUT "${BASE}/settings/{settingName}" \
  -H "${AUTH}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}'

# Multiple settings
curl -s -X POST "${BASE}/settings" \
  -H "${AUTH}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"setting1": "value1", "setting2": 42}'

# Tag properties via settings
curl -s -X POST "${BASE}/settings" \
  -H "${AUTH}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"_tag[123].name": "New Name", "_tag[123].visibility": "enabled"}'
```
